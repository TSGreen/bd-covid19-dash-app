# bd-covid19-dash-app

Repo for deploying a data visulation web-app of COVID-19 data in Bangladesh to Heroku. 

This app is built using Dash in Python and displays interactive Plotly visualtions. 

The data used in this repo is scraped, cleaned and analysed in my main [Covid-19 Bangladesh](https://github.com/TSGreen/Covid-19_Bangladesh) repo.

The app is avilable [here on Heroku](https://bangladesh-covid19.herokuapp.com/). Note it is deployed on Heroku's free tier so may take some time to wake from sleep. Please be patient!
